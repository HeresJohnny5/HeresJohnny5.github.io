# John Erickson

With a unquenchable thirst to learn new things and more important support of my loving wife, I decided to seek out a career change. In August of 2016 I attended a coding bootcamp, completing a 16-week intensive Full Stack Web Development curriculum. Throughout the Bootcamp I learned programming funamentals using the Ruby programming language and how to build state of the art web pages, and desktop applications using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript

I currently work as a Learning and Development Specialist at PNC where I assist in determining learning needs and objectives for various departments within the University. Acting as liaison between two technology teams I develop custom web-based solutions using several web application technologies.
